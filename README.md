# Living Sculpture
Living Sculpture is a project created as part of the Data as Material class assignment, Spring 2025, at Parsons School of Design. This interactive experience allows users to upload or capture images and analyze poses using ML5.js, matching them to the postures of Buddhist sculptures from The MET Open Access Collection.
